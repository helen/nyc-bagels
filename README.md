# NYC Bagels
Where to get a decent bagel near each subway stop in NYC.

## Why?
Because I am constantly finding myself with just enough time to grab a bagel between whatever subway stop I've gotten off at and the place I need to be, but without enough time to go digging through Yelp or Foursquare, and it's worse to get a bad bagel than no bagel at all. No need to get righteous about toasters, style, amount of cream cheese, or anything like that - we've all got different preferences (though obviously a warm fresh bagel or [one that's been reheated by being toasted *before* slicing](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/09/how-to-reheat-old-bagels.html) is ideal).

## What's the plan?
Right now, to start collecting places. Eventually, I'd love for this to be able to generate/display as maps and lists, as inspired by existing [coffee](http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/nyc_coffee_map.php) [maps](https://www.thrillist.com/drink/new-york/the-nyc-coffee-shop-subway-map). And then maybe this could be a base for creating subway stop guides to any number of things!

P.S. I proudly live in Jersey City, so don't be mad if I include PATH stops.

## Contributing
I have no current fixed ideas about formats, structure, etc. Ideally wherever this lands would support the above plan. I am also not the world's greatest side project maintainer, so hopefully I'll be able to add other maintainers if this catches on and needs more eyes.

Please: PRs for additions into whatever format exists, or issues for talking about things like structural changes or generators before getting into PRs for those. If you see a recommendation that is really, truly bad (or perhaps deeply mediocre), open an issue to talk about it. Remember: the goal is to be able to acquire a bagel that will leave you satisfied, not to prove anybody's bagel snobbery.
